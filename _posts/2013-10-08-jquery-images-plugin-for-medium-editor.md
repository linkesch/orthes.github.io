title: jQuery images plugin for MediumEditor
---

If you're a web developer, I'm sure you've came through a phase of searching for sufficient **JavaScript WYSIWYG editor for your CMS**. And I'm sure you've ended up with either

- heavyweight champion, which can not only edit a text, but make you a coffee while controlling a power plant
- or with some lightweight alternative, which hardly made even simple editing text right

What have these two options most likely in common is a toolbar copied and pasted from MS Word from 80s.

Sadly, that's what we're all used to. But in 21st century must be a better way.


## medium.com

That's when I stumbled upon [medium.com](http://medium.com) and fell in love with it's beautiful editor. Simple, clean, minimalistic and intuitive.

I was even happier when I found it's free open source clone on github - [**MediumEditor**](https://github.com/daviferreira/medium-editor). [Davi Ferreira](https://github.com/daviferreira) did a great job preserving it's beauty and cleanness.


## jQuery images plugin for MediumEditor

For me and for using it on [creator5](http://www.creator5.com) there was only one last piece missing - **images**. MediumEditor currently doesn't handle images at all. That's why I've developed the first version of [**jQuery images plugin for MediumEditor**](http://bit.ly/16Ps7c3).

The plugin is inspired by medium.com, too and goes further with **native HTML5 drag&drop**.
