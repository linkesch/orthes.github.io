title: Battery Prolonger
---

I released my first **Mac OS X application** named [**Battery Prolonger**](https://bit.ly/153Gqq4).

Battery Prolonger is a simple application, that informs you when is **the best time to plug in/unplug your MacBook** to/from a power adapter to **prolong your battery life**.

## Why?

Battery Prolonger is small utility programmed one evening after reading [an article on wired.com](https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/09/laptop-battery) about how to make the most of your notebook's battery.

_"Cadex Electronics CEO Isidor Buchmann told WIRED that ideally everyone would charge their batteries to 80 percent then let them drain to about 40 percent. This will prolong the life of your battery — in some cases by as much as four times."_

The article concludes with _"Keeping an eye on your computer’s battery level while trying to work can be a pain."_ and _"A search of Windows and OS X apps yielded nothing that would alert a user when a computer reached both an 80 percent charge and a 40 percent discharge."._

Well that's no longer truth at least for OS X. Here comes Battery Prolonger.

## How does Battery Prolonger look like?

## What it does?

This small app simply notifies you:

- When your battery is charged enough (80%) and you can unplug it from power adapter
- When remains less then 40% of MacBook's battery and you should plug it in to socket

Nothing more, nothing less and it still helps to prolong the life of your battery. According to Wired magazine _"in some cases by as much as four times"._

## How to get it?

Battery Prolonger is a **free app** released as **open source** under MIT license.
