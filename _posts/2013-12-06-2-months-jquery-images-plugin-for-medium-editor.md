title: 2 months of my open source project "jQuery insert plugin for MediumEditor"
---

Two months ago [I released my open source project](/2013/10/08/jquery-images-plugin-for-medium-editor/), jQuery image plugin for MediumEditor.

In this short time, it started to gain some initial traction, which proves, that need for this plugin is not only mine (51 stars and 10 forks on [Github](https://github.com/orthes/medium-editor-insert-plugin)).

These days I made major changes in the plugin code and the approach. What was previously a dedicated image plugin is now an **insert plugin, that handles not only images, but (coming soon) files, maps and more**.

With this big changes comes natural renaming to [jQuery insert plugin for MediumEditor](https://github.com/orthes/medium-editor-insert-plugin).

The plugin is starting to attract some first attention, first feature requests, first bug reports and pull requests. Try it out, join us and contribute at [Github](https://github.com/orthes/medium-editor-insert-plugin).
