<hr>

<p>I've been programming websites professionally for 12+ years now. I've worked with companies all around the world, I had my own startup, I have experience as a freelancer/contractor. All this using and sharpening my weapons of choice:</p>

<ul>
    <li>JavaScript (ES2015+) - React, Redux, Styled Components, Flux, Backbone.js, Marionette, RequireJS, jQuery, QUnit, Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, CoffeeScript</li>
	<li>NodeJS - Express, KeystoneJS</li>
	<li>PHP - Symfony2, Silex, PHPUnit, Selenium</li>
	<li>DB - MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite</li>
	<li>CSS - Sass</li>
	<li>HTML5</li>
	<li>Webpack, Grunt, Gulp</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though I have a wide range of battle-proven skills, I'm focusing mostly on JavaScript these days.</p>

<p>I'm also a huge fan of <a href="https://github.com/orthes">open-source</a>. I'm a core contributor to <a href="https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor">medium-editor</a> (the most starred WYSIWYG editor on Github).</p>

<p>Besides this, I graduated from Technical University of Ko≈°ice with a master's degree in <strong>cybernetics</strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks to the college field of study I'm experienced in C, C#, Assembly, PLC, Oracle Database and OLAP, Matlab, Wonderware and RSLogix.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my specialty and passion is <strong>web development</strong>.</p>
