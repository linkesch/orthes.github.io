title: About me
---

<p>I'm a co-founder and a developer of <a href="http://www.creator5.com">creator5</a>, an internet start-up helping mostly small and medium companies to build their web sites easier than ever.</p>

<p>At the same time, I work as a <strong>freelancer</strong> making use of my 9 years of professional experience in web development. I'm a big fan of testing and especially Test Driven Development.</p>

<p>My weapons of choice:</p>

<ul>
	<li>NodeJS - Express, KeystoneJS, Mocha</li>
	<li>JavaScript - RequireJS, Backbone.js, jQuery, QUnit</li>
	<li>PHP - Symfony2, Silex, PHPUnit, Selenium</li>
	<li>DB - MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite</li>
	<li>CSS - Sass, Compass</li>
	<li>HTML5</li>
	<li>Grunt</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides this, I graduated from Technical University of Ko≈°ice with an Ing. degree (a master's degree in engineering) in <strong>cybernetics</strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks to the college field of study I'm experienced in C, C#, Assembly, PLC, Oracle Database and OLAP, Matlab, Wonderware and RSLogix.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, my specialty and passion is <strong>web development</strong>.</p>
